# Predictive maintenance using LSTM

This example is based on the [LSTM for Predictive Maintenance on Pump Sensor Data](https://towardsdatascience.com/lstm-for-predictive-maintenance-on-pump-sensor-data-b43486eb3210) tutorial.
It includes the various steps we need to perform until we apply the model, such as:
- cleaning data
- removing NaNs,
- outlier removal/Noise reduction,
- feature selection,
- create timeseries data and
- normalise/standardize
